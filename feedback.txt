Feedback on the tests - how could they have been improved:
    Qustion: 
        Using different names for result and results may cause test errors:
            const result = screen.queryByTestId("result");
            expect(result).not.toBeInTheDocument();

            const result = screen.queryByTestId("results");
            expect(result).toBeInTheDocument();

    OptionList:
        You need to make sure that each button displays the correct text:
            const buttons = screen.getAllByRole('button');
            expect(buttons).toHaveLength(4);

            buttons.forEach((button, index) => {
                expect(button).toHaveTextContent(questions[0].options[index]);
            });

What was missed in the initial tests.
    Qustion: 
        Check <h3> with the exact text of the current question from the questions array.
        Checking that Next and Finish buttons are not displayed at the same time
